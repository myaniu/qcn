qcn 

Sensor Location w/ floor
Quick question: Any chance you can include floor number in the BOINC side
computer location/Google apps like you did for the QCN_Live locatino?

---------------------------
low priority:
1) An email notification every time we receive a trigger overlapping with a
USGS quake. That way we know right away. Set a threshold of 3.8, so we don't
get a bunch of junk.

---------------------------
2) A map of quakes that have associated qcn triggers (low priority, but
would help).  I can probably get a grad student on this or something, but it
would be nice to have it automatically updating.

---------------------------
doc/sac2png or sac2jpeg -- on the server we can generate an image from the SAC uploads
Create a png file for each uploaded data group
(S,X,Y,Z). The script requires sac (including sgftops) and imagemagick
(http://www.imagemagick.org - available through fink/fink commander 

---------------------------

trigger levels

We will probably have to try various thresholds for the different sensors and see how many triggers we get. Presumably we will also have an idea of 'noise level' from those continuous records for the JW and MN. The UCLA trip was postponed again, so I don't yet have the instrument response to do the noise study. Hopefully that will happen this week or next (once their equipment is fixed).

I don't think we should do a changing trigger threshold - what if we are trying to catch many aftershocks- we don't want to arbitrarily damp those out? - also we don't necessarily want one trigger per hour for the JW/MN because hopefully we will only get triggers for earthquakes on these, so it could be days/months between triggers if they are in a quiet site.

I’ve been wondering about this as well.  Right now I think we have a single threshold for all the sensors, which is tuned for the Macs (0.1m/s/s – which is 2.5 times the resolution of the sensor).  We are definitely going to have to adjust the threashold according to the sensor type.  I was thinking that we could have two changes to the threshold:

Use a different starting thresholds for each sensor.  My proposed values are:
MN = 0.02
JW = 0.06
Apple = 0.1
Thinkpad = 0.2
If more than 1 real trigger happens in an hour, we should double the trigger threshold.  If 0 real triggers happen in the past 2 hours then halve the threshold. This will auto-adjust the triggers so that we balance the tradeoff of minimizing the number of false triggers and maximizing the sensitivity.

QCNLive

cut-and-paste doesn't work for lat,lng in local prefs box -- also a way to integrate google maps lookup?

---------------------------
for the following refer to doc/Sensor_Directions.pdf

We received a little feedback from our friends at IRIS regarding QCNLive.
First, they really like it (that's good news). They made a few suggestions
to make QCNLive more student/teacher friendly (remember many of our users
are at a 6th grade or younger comprehension level). Fortunately many of
these suggestions are on our list. I interspersed my comments in BOLD.

A) Seismogram Viewing:
1) Vertical axes for x,y,z,&s (I THINK THIS IS ON YOUR LIST ANYWAYS).

2) Can you start with significance toggled off? Without
explanation, it is hard to understand for first-timers. Let them
get used to x, y, & z, then significance. (WE SHOULD PROBABLY DEFINE
SIGNIFICANCE SOMWHERE IN THE PROGRAM - SIGNAL SIGNIFICANCE = (CURRENT
SIGNAL) / (NOISE IN THE LAST MINUTE) )

3) Make the forward & backward time motions more fluid. Make the time
zoom more fluid - not just static 1 min, 10 min, 60 min. (I THINK
THIS IS ALSO ON YOUR LIST. ALSO IF YOU COULD ALLOW THE USER TO ZOOM
MORE FLUIDLY ON THE VERTICAL AXIS, THAT WOULD BE AWESOME!)

4) Make a diagram of what directions x, y, & z are. (I MADE 2 QUICK
LITTLE FIGURES - ATTACHED HERE. FEEL FREE TO MAKE A FIGURE OF YOUR
OWN OR CHANGE THE FIGURES ANY WAY YOU WANT.)

(I JUST NOTICED THAT WE SHOULD PROBABLY RE-DEFINE X, Y, & Z FOR THE
MOTION NODE. Z SHOULD BE UP. X TO RIGHT WHEN USB CABLE IS POINTED
AWAY FROM YOU. Y SHOULD BE IN THE DIRECTION THAT THE USB CABLE IS
POINTING OUT OF THE BOX. THIS MAKES IT THE SAME AS THE MAC.)

5) Can you make the text easier to read? Some of the colored text words
are hard to read on the black background. (OR COULD WE CHANGE THE
BLACK BACKGROUND TO WHITE OR GREY FOR QCNLive? BOLD MIGHT WORK TOO.
WHATEVER IS EASIEST/BEST IS FINE BY ME.).

6) Can you simplify the box. It is hard to understand. I think there is
too much going on. (I'VE TALKED TO A FEW PEOPLE ABOUT THIS BOX. MOST
OF THEM LIKE IT, BUT HAVE TROUBLE UNDERSTANDING IT. IF WE CAN MAKE
THE BOX MOVE RIGHT FOR POSITIVE X, UP FOR POSITIVE Z, AND INTO THE
SCREEN FOR POSITIVE Y, THAT WOULD DO THE TRICK. STOP IT FROM
ROTATING. HAVE IT GROW AND SHRINK FOR LARGER MAGNITUDE?).

7) A link from the software to an instructional website would be use for
after the user has played with it. (I REALLY LIKE THIS. A LEARN MORE
BUTTON THAT LINKS BACK TO QCN).

---------------------------

B) Globe Viewing:
1) Can you have a scale on the right that shows the size of a 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7, and 8+ magnitude earthquake? (I think this is a great idea!)

2) Also a legend on the right showing blue circle=historic event, red
circle=last week eq.

3) Can you increase small yellow font size? It is hard to read on many
displays.

priorities are QCNLive with start-stop recording and a few other cosmetics and
functionality issues. 

a) 10 second (or 1 minute or 10 minute) numbers on the horizontal so it is even easier to see.  
b) An option to scale the vertical and horizontal scales to various levels.  Not just scaled & absolute.
c) A scroll bar at the bottom to more fluidly move back through time.
d) Tick marks that move against our current tick marks in 10 second intervals.

e) They would particularly like to see a way to read sensor data back into QCNLive. (this is something I would love too, but doesn’t need to be done right away).

IRIS has access to lots of tools that we could integrate into QCN: For example:

todo sensor text output:

Station Name: SNAME

0.020, -12.129, 129.010,  19.010
0.040,  -8.010,   1.001,  -0.999


When you do get around to qcnwx, there are some things I'd like
added/changed.

1) I'd like to add a button for record/stop recording, so that users can
output the series they want.

2) Several users have requested an xyz output instead of sac. So, I'd like a
switch to toggle back and forth between xyz and sac output.

3) output jpg files to a pic directory rather than sac directory

------------------------

* small program to verify accelerometer is on the system and what type(s) found

------------------------

trigger map:

Can we add the plate boundaries (like with the globe viewing)?  Elizabeth
may have the faults for California as well. That would be really cool!!!! If
those could be button options either on the side or on the map it would be
great!!!!!

Could we have a plot of recent earthquakes? Either as a button option on the
same map, or as a second identical map.  The USGS has maps for these
earthquakes, but I figure it is nice to have maps in the same format.

Carl,

Yes, it generally looks pretty good. It was mainly to support the main thing/you for several years.  We’re bringing in some collaborators 1) to help sell the thing as a product with community-wide demand, and 2) to get help with aspects like how QCN relates to structural engineering, getting a bunch of sensors in Columbia, and relating QCN to other early warning systems like Elarms.  It has a $1.2M pricetag, which will probably rise to 1.5 in the final proposal.  I’m inclined to front-load the proposal to get more funding sooner, which will fit better with the current infusion of funds into NSF by Obama.

For the proposal I think we’re going to need to work on things like:
Ways to share data in real/near-real time with the users & scientists
Redundant data collection (i.e. qcn-columbia)
Real-time data analysis/earthquake detection
Automatic clustering algorithms to group sensors/triggers for detection
linked with redundant data collection
organized by location
cluster must be large enough for statistics to work
depends on number of USB/regular sensors
Include data from regular networks
Automatic detection algorithms
Locate event (for eq verification)
Determine event magnitude from distances/amplitudes
Notifications for large events (delayed by a minute or so – first to us, then to everyone)
Automatic adjustments for trigger parameters for sensors that trigger too often.
Automatic adjustments for slower sampling rate if NTP drifts. 0.02-0.2-0.5-1 sps.
Incorporate data from regular sensor networks
Make separate qcn system for week-long building analyses where we collect data continuously on all sensors in a building – requires additional information like floor/level.
We’ll want to group this data by building
We’ll want to run some automatic codes on the data (this could be distributed as well)
See http://pangea.stanford.edu/~gprieto/images/fmov1.avi for example of building results

From your view what are the major challenges for cyber-boinc-qcn.
