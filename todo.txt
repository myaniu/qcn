-- client/main.cpp --- why does the loop for the ping/quakelist trigger go 15 minutes on Mac's, but 30 minutes on Win (should be 30)

-- higher priority levels
OK, here's a fix for this:
make your app version of plan class "nci"
(this just means adding "__nci" to the directory name under apps/; see
http://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/wiki/UpdateVersions and
http://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/wiki/AppPlan

and upgrade to the latest scheduler.
This will tell the client that your app uses .01 of a CPU.
Then the very latest client (i.e. 6.8, whenever we release it)
will run the app at process priority BELOW_NORMAL_PRIORITY_CLASS
(i.e., above idle).

I think we'll need to add a new trickle for a status/state of health report.
It would be very helpful to know how much of the time the sensor is working,
and working properly.

Reason 1: A USB sensor that is properly mounted to the floor and running all
the time, should only trigger in the event of a big earthquake.  We won't
know if it is running until we get the trigger.  If we are to run statistics
on the sensors, we need to know a rough number of sensors connected to the
network.

Reason 2: The USB sensors are not showing up on our maps due to just
triggers!

So I was thinking it would be nice to have a trickle that uploaded a state
of health message every 15 minutes, giving a few pieces of information.  The
info that could be useful would be:
    1) Computer ID/info
    2) NTP time & timing error
    3) running properly=1, calibrating=0, or no sensor found=-1
    4) Anything else we need?

It might be helpful if the same trickle uploaded every time the computer
started re-calibrating due to timing error.

Reason 3: It would help us to create a time series of the state of health
signals.  That way we'd be able to determine if the computer was operating
properly or having troubles.

How hard would this be to implement?

Sensor Location w/ floorWednesday, January 7, 2009 1:45 PM
Quick question: Any chance you can include floor number in the BOINC side
computer location/Google apps like you did for the QCN_Live locatino?

qcnlive

At File>Local Settings is the ability to set your location in Lat/Long, elevation and floors. Since there was nothing in the install manuals regarding this, how important is the information? Also the nomenclature for the Longitude is opposite that used by Google Maps. For Google, West is negative, an accepted convention. QCNLive uses (-180[E] to 180[W]).


Standardize/Normalize readings to +/- 2g

So, I've been playing with the new JW sensors that arrived.  I wanted to
test them out before shipping them.  It seems to me that triggers for the
USB sensors respond very differently than the triggers for the internal Mac
sensor, even though the two should be about the same sensitivity. My first
thought was that this difference is due to a hard-wired value above which
the fmag must be for a trigger (1.25) and the fact that the different
sensors provide different values for the same force/g. For the Macs, 1g =
257. For JW 1g = 1 (I think).  We should normalize each sensor by it's
sensitivity, so that 1g = 1g. I think this can be done for the mac laptops
by dividing x, y, & z by 257 in the sensor/csensor_mac_laptop.cpp within
CSensorMacLaptop::read_xyz (lines 261-263).  I think we then must divide the
value above which fmag must be equal to by 257 for the triggering to stay
even (Line 600 in client/main/qcn_thread_sensor.cpp).  Once this is done, I
think the USB sensors will trigger better for the JW.

I tried to change things on my local computer but I seem to be having some
weirdness with svn/ and the making of QCNLive.


QCNLive

cut-and-paste doesn't work for lat,lng in local prefs box -- also a way to integrate google maps lookup?

for the following refer to doc/Sensor_Directions.pdf

We received a little feedback from our friends at IRIS regarding QCNLive.
First, they really like it (that's good news). They made a few suggestions
to make QCNLive more student/teacher friendly (remember many of our users
are at a 6th grade or younger comprehension level). Fortunately many of
these suggestions are on our list. I interspersed my comments in BOLD.

A) Seismogram Viewing:
1) Vertical axes for x,y,z,&s (I THINK THIS IS ON YOUR LIST ANYWAYS).

2) Can you start with significance toggled off? Without
explanation, it is hard to understand for first-timers. Let them
get used to x, y, & z, then significance. (WE SHOULD PROBABLY DEFINE
SIGNIFICANCE SOMWHERE IN THE PROGRAM - SIGNAL SIGNIFICANCE = (CURRENT
SIGNAL) / (NOISE IN THE LAST MINUTE) )

3) Make the forward & backward time motions more fluid. Make the time
zoom more fluid - not just static 1 min, 10 min, 60 min. (I THINK
THIS IS ALSO ON YOUR LIST. ALSO IF YOU COULD ALLOW THE USER TO ZOOM
MORE FLUIDLY ON THE VERTICAL AXIS, THAT WOULD BE AWESOME!)

4) Make a diagram of what directions x, y, & z are. (I MADE 2 QUICK
LITTLE FIGURES - ATTACHED HERE. FEEL FREE TO MAKE A FIGURE OF YOUR
OWN OR CHANGE THE FIGURES ANY WAY YOU WANT.)

(I JUST NOTICED THAT WE SHOULD PROBABLY RE-DEFINE X, Y, & Z FOR THE
MOTION NODE. Z SHOULD BE UP. X TO RIGHT WHEN USB CABLE IS POINTED
AWAY FROM YOU. Y SHOULD BE IN THE DIRECTION THAT THE USB CABLE IS
POINTING OUT OF THE BOX. THIS MAKES IT THE SAME AS THE MAC.)

5) Can you make the text easier to read? Some of the colored text words
are hard to read on the black background. (OR COULD WE CHANGE THE
BLACK BACKGROUND TO WHITE OR GREY FOR QCNLive? BOLD MIGHT WORK TOO.
WHATEVER IS EASIEST/BEST IS FINE BY ME.).

6) Can you simplify the box. It is hard to understand. I think there is
too much going on. (I'VE TALKED TO A FEW PEOPLE ABOUT THIS BOX. MOST
OF THEM LIKE IT, BUT HAVE TROUBLE UNDERSTANDING IT. IF WE CAN MAKE
THE BOX MOVE RIGHT FOR POSITIVE X, UP FOR POSITIVE Z, AND INTO THE
SCREEN FOR POSITIVE Y, THAT WOULD DO THE TRICK. STOP IT FROM
ROTATING. HAVE IT GROW AND SHRINK FOR LARGER MAGNITUDE?).

7) A link from the software to an instructional website would be use for
after the user has played with it. (I REALLY LIKE THIS. A LEARN MORE
BUTTON THAT LINKS BACK TO QCN).

B) Globe Viewing:
1) Can you have a scale on the right that shows the size of a 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7, and 8+ magnitude earthquake? (I think this is a great idea!)

2) Also a legend on the right showing blue circle=historic event, red
circle=last week eq.

3) Can you increase small yellow font size? It is hard to read on many
displays.

priorities are QCNLive with start-stop recording and a few other cosmetics and
functionality issues. 

a) 10 second (or 1 minute or 10 minute) numbers on the horizontal so it is even easier to see.  
b) An option to scale the vertical and horizontal scales to various levels.  Not just scaled & absolute.
c) A scroll bar at the bottom to more fluidly move back through time.
d) Tick marks that move against our current tick marks in 10 second intervals.

e) They would particularly like to see a way to read sensor data back into QCNLive. (this is something I would love too, but doesnâ€™t need to be done right away).

IRIS has access to lots of tools that we could integrate into QCN: For example:
http://rev.seis.sc.edu/stations.html
http://rev.seis.sc.edu/

todo:

Station Name: SNAME
Longitude: -117.12321
Latitude: 34.92834
Elevation: 239
Floor: 0
File Start Time: 11/07/2008 12:34:20
File End Time: 11/07/2008 12:35:40
 Time,       x,       y,       z
0.000,  -1.293,   2.393,  -0.123
0.020, -12.129, 129.010,  19.010
0.040,  -8.010,   1.001,  -0.999


When you do get around to qcnwx, there are some things I'd like
added/changed.

1) I'd like to add a button for record/stop recording, so that users can
output the series they want.

2) Several users have requested an xyz output instead of sac. So, I'd like a
switch to toggle back and forth between xyz and sac output.

3) output jpg files to a pic directory rather than sac directory

* small program to verify accelerometer is on the system and what type(s) found

trigger map:

Can we add the plate boundaries (like with the globe viewing)?  Elizabeth
may have the faults for California as well. That would be really cool!!!! If
those could be button options either on the side or on the map it would be
great!!!!!

Could we have a plot of recent earthquakes? Either as a button option on the
same map, or as a second identical map.  The USGS has maps for these
earthquakes, but I figure it is nice to have maps in the same format.
