We tried to keep the data as simple as possible. The data looks like:
 
##xxyyzzs
 
Two ASCII '#' (x23) followed by the X value upper byte, X value lower byte, Y value upper byte, Y value lower byte, Z value upper byte, Z value lower byte and an eight bit checksum.  The bytes are tightly packed and there is nothing between the data values except for the sentence start ##.  The X and Y axis will have a 0g offset at 32768d (x8000) and the Z axis offset at +1g 45874d (xB332) when oriented in the X/Y horizontal and Z up position.  The ‘s’ value is a one byte checksum.  It is a sum of all of the bytes, truncated to the lower byte.  This firmware does not transmit the temperature value.
 
Finding g as a value:
g  = x - 32768 * (5 / 65536)
 
Where: x is the data value 0 - 65536 (x0000 to xFFFF). Values >32768 are positive g and <32768 are negative g.
 
The sampling rate is set to 200Hz, and the analog low-pass filters are set to 50Hz.  The data is oversampled 2X over Nyquist.
 
We are going to make a new version of the module, with 25Hz LP analog filters and dual sensitivity 2g / 6g shortly.  Same drivers, same interface.  I’ll get you one as soon as I we get feedback on this and make a set of those.
