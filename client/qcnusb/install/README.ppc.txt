To install the Mac PowerPPC QCN driver, you will need to open up a Terminal window,
cd to the directory where you downloaded and unzipped the qcnusb-ppc.zip file, 
and type:   ./install_ppc

Follow the prompts to login for administrator access.  This should install the driver,
start it, and it will start on subsequent logins/reboots as well.

To unstall, save the pre-install.sh script and run that as root i.e. type:  sudo ./pre-install.sh
