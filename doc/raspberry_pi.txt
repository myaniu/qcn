gzip -d qcn_boinc_raspi_8gb_sd_card.img.gz

Raspberry Pi:

http://elinux.org/RPi_Hardware_Basic_Setup

armv6l-unknown-linux-gnueabihf

notes:
1) clock seems to be bad, but corrects with ntpdate as usual
2) onavi has the most trouble - probably usb troubles
3) still a lot of resets, made a custom boinc-arm that runs at high priority & root
4) need to run as root for phidgets and high priority
5) may be best to look into an accelerometer plug-in onto the RPi board 
   (i.e. bypass the USB interface which is the bottleneck)?
