This is code that is included in the boinc/sched build process so that msg_from_host insert's are
intercepted and put into the qcn_trigger table (built by using ../qcn-data.sql)

Note that triggers never actually end up in msg_from_host but go right to qcn_trigger (with
associated data in the qcn_host_ipaddr and qcn_geo_ipaddr lookup tables).

Important Note:  In the boinc/sched/Makefile you will need to add -lcurl to
the cgi_LDADD library list (as curl is used for the maxmind.com/geoip lookup)

Usually just edit the line in boinc/sched/Makefile:

cgi_LDADD = $(LDADD)

to be:

cgi_LDADD = -lcurl $(LDADD)

Also note you need to copy the qcn/server/boincmods files to their appropriate
place (boinc/db or boinc/sched) as this has the appropriate lines to include
these mods for the triggers.
