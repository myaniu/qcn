By clicking submit you agree to these terms:The sensor is distributed as part of an experimental research project by the Quake Catcher Network, a project of Stanford University and the University of California at Riverside. Two computer programs that can be obtained separately for free are necessary for intended use of the sensor. A computer program called QCNLive is necessary to see the sensorâ€™s measurements and a computer program called BOINC is necessary to upload data to QCN. In order to install and use these two free computer programs, you must consent to the privacy policies and terms of use governing each, which may change. The sensor is sold as is and with all faults. The sensor and the free software are experimental and may not function as expected for the only two intended purposes: education and submitting data to QCN. Without limiting the foregoing, this device will not provide warning of an earthquake nor will this device protect you from an earthquake in any way. The seller disclaims all warranties, including merchantability. Keep the sensor out of reach of small children and pets and do not use it for any purpose in which harm would result if the sensor and/or the software did not work as expected.
