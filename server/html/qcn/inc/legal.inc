<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>\n<h2>The qcn.stanford.edu Privacy Policy:</h2>\n<p align=\"justify\"><strong>Introduction:</strong><p align=\"justify\">Thank you for visiting the Quake-Catcher Network's Web site, qcn.stanford.edu. We know privacy is an important issue for our visitors, and we want you to know that QCN takes privacy seriously. Please take a minute to review our qcn.stanford.edu privacy policy, which describes what types and categories of personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable information we collect from visitors to qcn.stanford.edu, the purposes for which we use this information, and the categories of third parties to whom and under what circumstances we disclose this information. This policy only applies to information we collect through qcn.stanford.edu and for qcn.stanford.edu through Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC boinc.stanford.edu).\n<p align=\"justify\"><strong>The Collection of Information on qcn.stanford.edu:</strong>\n<p align=\"justify\"><i>Non-Participant Viewer:</i>\n<p align=\"justify\">When visitors access qcn.stanford.edu, QCN may automatically collect non-personally identifiable information about them, including, among other things, the links visitors use to arrive at qcn.stanford.edu, the domain and host from which visitors access the Internet, the type of Web browser that visitors use, the type of operating system in use, IP addresses, and the number and frequency of visitors who visit various pages of our site. \n<p align=\"justify\"><i>Participant Viewer:</i>\n<p align=\"justify\">We only collect personally identifiable information about visitors when they voluntarily submit it to us. For example, we ask for information when a visitor registers for an account or service through qcn.stanford.edu. We also ask for a visitor's name and email address if the visitor wants to submit a question to us via email message or wishes to link to qcn.stanford.edu. All visitors who create accounts are asked for country and postal code information.\n<p align=\"justify\">Visitors who participate in online seismic data acquisition through the distributed computing program, BOINC (http://qcn.stanford.edu), may choose to enter their sensor location (longitude and latitude) (i) into an online web form, (ii) automatically based on IPAddress lookup with GeoIP, (iii) via a GoogleMap, or (iv) via an online Google address lookup button.  Information from the latter two methods necessarily transfers location information to and from Google.com, but does not transfer any other information associated with the query. If option (iv) is used, the address information is erased after the form is submitted, and no record is stored. Accuracy of   The GeoIP lookup transfers an IP address to Maxmind, and receives approximate longitude and latitude information.  The visiting participant may choose to share the location an approximate location (with precision up to approximately 0.1 to 1km) or the exact location provided.  No assurance is given that the end user provides an exact location.   Maps of current sensor, and in some cases, past sensor locations are illustrated in various locations online.\n<p align=\"justify\"><strong>Collection of Information Through BOINC:</strong>\n<p align=\"justify\">Online profile pages are automatically generated at qcn.stanford.edu using information collected through BOINC.  An online host-details page is created for each participant in qcn.stanford.edu/sensor and qcn.stanford.edu/continual.  The detail’s page provides information such as (but not not all inclusively) (i) user name, (ii) date the account was created, (iii) total credits, (iv) Cross-project credits, (v) CPU Type, (vi) number of processors, (vii) operating system, (viii) memory, (ix) cache, (x) measured floating point speed, (xi) measured integer speed, (xii) average upload rate, (xiii) average download rate, (xiv) average turnaround time, (xv) Maximum daily WU quota per CPU, and (xvi) number of tasks completed.\n<p align=\"justify\"><strong>Seismic Data and Metadata:</strong>\n<p align=\"justify\">The online host-details page as well as search pages, earthquake details pages also provide information about uploaded metadata and data related to observed seismic vibrations recorded from participating sensors.  This information includes, but is not limited to, (i) the sensor-computer trigger time, (ii) the trigger time received at the server, (iii) the time the clock was last synced prior to the trigger(i), (iv) significance/magnitude of the accelerations at the time of the trigger, (v) longitude, latitude, elevation of the sensor (vi) if the sensor is aligned to north, (vii) the number of sensor resets on the current task, (viii) the type of sensor, (ix) version of client software that collected the data, (x) operating system, (xi) run time of the current computer task, (xii) file names of seismic data generated by the host computer, (xiii) and whether the data have been uploaded for viewing.  Some, but not all of this metadata, is included in the sac2000 file format used for storing and disseminating seismic data.  The seismic data records are viewable as images (jpg, gif, png, and other image formats) and downloadable in zipped sac2000 format from various pages on qcn.stanford.edu.  For more information on sac2000, please visit http://www.iris.edu/software/sac/. \n<p align=\"justify\"><strong>Use of Information:</strong>\n<p align=\"justify\">We may use non-personally identifiable information collected from visitors to qcn.stanford.edu to review our Web site, to guide decisions about developing qcn.stanford.edu, and to provide an enhanced online experience for our visitors. We may also use non-personally identifiable information to identify, on an aggregate basis, scientific discovery and innovation. For example, researchers may use QCN seismic data collected by participants to better constrain earthquake processes or evaluate better methods for detecting earthquakes more rapidly. Emails may be sent from the QCN forum webpages, but with anonymous email.\n<p align=\"justify\">We may use personally identifiable information collected from visitors to qcn.stanford.edu for any of the following purposes: (1) to answer visitors' questions, (2) to provide services and other information visitors specifically request or register for through our Web site, (3) to develop and improve qcn.stanford.edu, (4) to protect the security and integrity of qcn.stanford.edu, (5) for internal relations purposes, or (6) for maintenance questions from QCN personnel and scientific affiliates.\n <p align=\"justify\"><strong>Exemption for Rapid Aftershock Mobilization Program (RAMP):</strong>If the visitor opts to participate in a RAMP (qcn.stanford.edu/ramp/), more information (e.g., street address, participant’s real name, phone number, and other pertinent contact information) are retained and may be disceminated.  This enables QCN personnel, and/or affiliated researchers and/or third-party agencies to contact you personally and share your information in the event of a major earthquake.  By agreeing to the terms and conditions of the RAMP participation, visitors deliberately and voluntarily agree to share this personal information.  In this case, a participant’s personal information is only shared with third party entities if a major earthquake occurs and a RAMP is activated in the region of the participant.  Personal data are only shared with a few individuals who all agree to protect this information. \n<p align=\"justify\"><strong>Sensor Purchasing and Shipping:</strong><p align=\"justify\">Shipping and handling information is collected via QCN’s sensor purchase web pages. Personal information is used to ensure fast, effective, and efficient shipping, handling, and billing.  The monetary transactions are performed through a secure third party (CyberSource) linked from qcn.stanford.edu.  Personal information is shared with CyberSource.  CyberSource does not share any personal information.  qcn.stanford.edu does not collect credit card information.\n<p align=\"justify\"><strong>Disclosure of Information:</strong>\n<p align=\"justify\">QCN may transfer or otherwise disclose the information it collects from its Web site visitors to contractors, consultants, regulators, and service providers, if the disclosure will enable that party to perform a business, professional, or technical-support function for the visitor or for QCN. For example, we may use service providers to offer customized search capabilities, to help provide services, including testing services, and information upon a visitor's request, or to improve the performance of qcn.stanford.edu. We require these service providers by contract to keep any personally identifiable information visitors provide on qcn.stanford.edu confidential. When visitors register for an event through qcn.stanford.edu, QCN may share personally identifiable registration information with appropriate parties involved in the event. QCN may also transfer or otherwise disclose personally identifiable information (1) in response to judicial process, (2) to protect against or prevent actual or potential fraud, claims, or other liability, (3) to provide information to law enforcement agencies or in connection with an investigation on a matter related to public safety (as permitted by law), or (4) if required to do so by law. \n<p align=\"justify\">QCN does not sell any personally identifiable information that visitors enter on qcn.stanford.edu and does not sell or disclose any such information to third parties for marketing purposes.\n<p align=\"justify\"><strong>Cookies:</strong>A \"cookie\" is a small text file that is placed on the hard drive of a visitor's computer. We may use cookies for several purposes such as (1) to provide better service and a more effective Web site, (2) to facilitate interaction with visitors' browsers, (3) to collect non-personally identifiable data, (4) to recognize visitors when they return to qcn.stanford.edu, and (5) to enable visitors to save data to view later. To use the cookie feature to view stored data at a later time, however, visitors must generally access qcn.stanford.edu from the same personal computer from which they originally provided the data. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies to store information. Visitors are always free to decline cookies, but in doing so they might not be able to use certain features on qcn.stanford.edu.\n<p align=\"justify\"><strong>Other Web Sites/Linked Third Parties:</strong>\n<p align=\"justify\">qcn.stanford.edu may contain links to third-party Web sites, including the Web sites of the QCN’s participating insurers as well as independent contractors that host QCN testing and on-line training Web sites. Our privacy policy does not apply to these linked Web sites. We generally have no control over the way in which the sponsors or owners of the third-party Web sites collect and use information, and so QCN does not endorse and is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of any of the linked Web sites. We recommend, therefore, that visitors review the posted privacy statements and other legal statements on any Web site they visit.\n <p align=\"justify\"><strong>Security:</strong>\n <p align=\"justify\">We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to maintain the confidentiality, security, and integrity of visitors' personally identifiable information. We allow access to personally identifiable information only to persons and entities engaging in activities permitted by this privacy policy. Although we strive to maintain the highest standards of privacy, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. QCN cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information visitors transmit to us, and visitors do so at their own risk.n<p align=\"justify\"><strong>Legal Disclosure:</strong>\n<p align=\"justify\">The qcn.stanford.edu privacy policy is subject to the qualifications and conditions described in qcn.stanford.edu's Legal Disclosure for information submitted to qcn.stanford.edu. \n<p align=\"justify\"><strong>Changes:</strong>\n<p align=\"justify\">We reserve the right to revise or change any terms of the qcn.stanford.edu privacy policy. To ensure visitors are aware of our current privacy practices, we recommend they check this Web site periodically. We will not materially change how we handle previously collected personally identifiable information without providing advance notice of such proposed changes on this Web site. Such changes will not take effect until at least 10 days after advance notice of the proposed changes is posted. \n<p align=\"justify\"><strong>Contacting QCN:</strong>\n<p align=\"justify\">If Web site visitors have any questions regarding the qcn.stanford.edu privacy policy, please feel free to contact us (http://qcn.stanford.edu/contact.php).\n
