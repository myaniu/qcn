A QCN partner at the University of Concepcion was testing a JoyWarrior USB sensor with the goal of introducing QCN to the region in the future. The sensor caught the M8.8 mainshock and a number of aftershocks that followed. The computer was attached to a backup power supply that kept the computer running for one hour after the earthquake knocked out power to most of the city.  Unfortunately, at the time of the earthquake the sensor was not connected to the floor, but most of the earthquake record looks surprisingly good. The very high accelerations approximately 15 seconds into the record may be the sensor falling off of the box it was sitting on.  <A HREF=\"http://qcn.stanford.edu/sensor/download/M8.8_first_trigger.png\">Click here to view the QCN output.</A><BR><BR>",
